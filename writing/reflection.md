# Reflection by Add Jacob Boord

## Using two fenced code blocks, please display two correct outputs from running your program
```
Calculating the reals of a quadratic equation with:
   a = 1.0
   b = 2.0
   c = 1.0
   x_one = -1.0
   x_two = -1.0
```

   x_one = (-0.49999999999999994+0.8660254037844386j)

## For each terminal window command, add an explanation to the following list

- `poetry run pylint rootfinder tests`:n This command allows for the program to be checked the written program for the industry standard python language.
- `poetry run pytest -s`: This command allows for the user to check that the program is functioning properly. It does so by taking the defined checks in the tests subdirectory and compares them to the outputs put forth from the corrected program.
- `git commit`: This command applies the changes to the directory that are logged on GitHub as commits. This is how the version history of the program can be tracked and viewed along with the changes that were made.
- `git push`: This command pushes the changes to the repository so that they appear on the GitHub website. This is where GitHub actions is run to check to see if the code meets the criteria for the laboratory assignment to be shown as correct and complete.

## After reading the assignment sheet and the referenced resources, what are "imaginary" numbers?

Imaginary numbers, also known as complex numbers, are an extension of real numbers in which all numbers are expressed as a sum of a real part and an imaginary part. This imaginary part is referred to as "j" in python and are multiples of the square root of -1.

## What was the greatest technical challenge that you faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced with this laboratory assignment was installing the poetry package for windows. The process was a difficult process in the beginning because this was the first time that I was dealing with the poetry packages. After finding difficulty with the installation of these, I watched a couple of YouTube videos to figure out how it functions. I was then able to get it properly installed and I was ready to begin my lab assignment. 

## After completing this assignment, what is task that you want to practice more? Why?

After completing this laboratory task, I would like to work more with debugging code segments because I feel as though it will help me master the language and begin to develop more problem solving skills with the python language. Seeing as though this is my first time working in depth with the python langauge, I find these debugging scenarios helpful for looking at python code segments in a more analytical approach. Overall, debugging is a fun task that requires thought and analysis which are two skills I want to improve, and I believe that if I practice debugging more, I will master these skills.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

I am grateful for the experience with the poetry packages and how they are installed. This is a funamental baseline for moving forward in the class as we progress into more complex programs that require the use of poetry. At first, I was unsure how to properly use the tools; however, as I went through the process described above, I was able to figure out how it functioned. Now, I feel confident in installing the poetry packages necessary for the assignments using the VS Code terminal in the proper files. This will help me with all assignments moving forward.
